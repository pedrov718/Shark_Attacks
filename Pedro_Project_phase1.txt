Idea 1: An analysis of shark attacks across the U.S possibly the world. The goal of this analysis would be to identify trends or variables that different encounters had in common. I will try to look at geographic location, weather, and possibly ocean currents/conditions i.e (temperature/tide conditions). 

Idea 2: This idea is more or less an extension of idea 1, instead of merely doing a descriptive analysis of shark encounters/attacks I am very interested in trying to predict future attack locations. This would involve looking at past incidents and trying to use machine learning tools to predict future incidents. However, doing this based merely on location data seems farfetched. I will most likely need to take into account ocean and atmospheric data as well. 

Idea 3: (Leaving the idea of sharks behind) As someone who has a passion for cinema I've always been interested in box office numbers. Often when reporting box office numbers, reporters will say a movie did or did not live up to its expectation. In today's day in age, I can only imagine how much money large production studios spend trying to predict the box office revenue of a film. For this project, I will use past box office data, along with google search result data, to try to predict the box office revenue of a given movie.   


For the two above ideas, I have already found a data set that compiles all known global encounters since the late 1800s. 

Here is a link to a website that has an interactive map: https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/shark-attacks/maps/world-interactive/ 

Here is a link to a data set I found: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/GSAF5.xls

A site that provides ocean data is the following: https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/access/

Kaggle has a good data set on movies released before 2017 however due to the pandemic, I wonder how different more current releases are: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv
 

Questions for reviewers: 

Do you think that a predictive analysis of this sort is feasible? I am very interested in this subject and have a passion for sharks, but many variables go into an encounter and many of them are unknown. 

Some shark scientists argue that most shark encounters are merely coincidences. If this is the case then would a program be able to predict such coincidences? 


One idea I had about predicting the success of a movie is to use social media sites to measure the popularity of the movie before its release. How can one measure popularity?
